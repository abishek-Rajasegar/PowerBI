Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to bring to your attention some improvements that can be made to the data
in our transaction and demography tables. These changes will help ensure data consistency,
 accuracy, and better usability for our analysis. 

Global Changes:
1. Removing Empty Columns: There are several columns in the transaction table that do not contain any data.
 It would be beneficial to remove these empty columns to streamline the dataset and avoid confusion.
2. Promoting First Row as Header: To enhance clarity and facilitate data analysis, 
I suggest promoting the first row of the transaction table as the header row.
 This will provide column names for easier identification and interpretation of the data.

Transaction Table:
1. Formatting Currency Columns: It would be helpful to change the formatting of columns that deal with prices to a currency format. 
This will enhance readability and ensure consistency when working with monetary values.

2.Online order columns has blank values so update the values to false. 
Than using True or false use online or non online orders which can provide a better understanding.  

Address Table:
1.State colum values are inconsistent.Either use full form or abbrivation.


Demography Table:
1. Consistent Naming Convention: The gender column in the demography table contains inconsistent data, 
with some entries using "F" and "M" instead of the proper naming conventions. 
To rectify this, I recommend using the full words "Female" and "Male" consistently throughout the column.

2. Correcting DOB Column Datatype: The DOB (Date of Birth) column in the demography table currently has an incorrect datatype.
It should be changed to a date format to ensure accurate calculations and enable appropriate date-based analysis.

3. Handling Missing Job Titles: There are a few instances where the job title is missing in the demography table.
To address this, it would be helpful to provide a valid job type for these individuals or replace the missing values with a general category such as "Others."

4. Meaningful Job Industry Category: Instead of using "n/a" as the job industry category, 
I suggest using more meaningful words that accurately describe the industry or provide additional context.

5. Removing Meaningless Default Column: There appears to be a default column in the demography table that does not serve any meaningful purpose.
It would be beneficial to remove this column to reduce clutter and improve data clarity.

6. Categorization Data: When working with categories involving country, region, state, or any other geographical information,
it is crucial to ensure the data is accurate and appropriately represented to support our analysis.

I kindly request your assistance in implementing these improvements to our data. By addressing these issues, we can enhance the quality of our analysis and decision-making processes. If you have any questions or require further clarification regarding these suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Abishek Rajasegar.
